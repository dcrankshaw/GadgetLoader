This project contains a GUI for transforming files created by Gadget simulations 
and post-processing products to a format that can be read by a SQLServer database.

It is based on an initial version by Tamas Szalay, with additions made by Gerard Lemson.
It was coded in VS 2005 and recently transformed automatically to VS 2008.
