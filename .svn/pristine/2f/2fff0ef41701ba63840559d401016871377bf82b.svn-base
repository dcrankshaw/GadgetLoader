Things to ask Alex about:

-How exactly does he want the logging output formatted?
-Are there other errors I should be catching
	(i.e. is there data integrity stuff he wants me to be doing, or
	more sanity checks to watch out for [such as how long it takes
	to read a snapshot])?
-Are we actually reading in from a database like I have it doing?
-What about how the command line parameters are formatted?
-Are we going to be automating reading the log files?


I picture it being launched from a bash script that has a list of
snapshots this loader instance will be running.


Not doing:

Write sql commands? Maybe not do this.
	-personally I think this would be done better by another
	script later in the pipe

Primary key support
(i.e. file partitioning)

add summary file writing to FOF and FFT processes


Errors I can think of:
-missing or bad CL parameters
-Can't connect to database
	-wrong DB name
	-wrong table name
-no results returned from database
-too many results returned from database
	-make timestep primary key
-Can't create output directory (for example can't find it
	or don't have read/write permissions)
-Corrupted data file
-The number of subfiles in the directory does not
  match the number of subfiles the data files say they have
-null object somewhere
	-something doesn't get initialized
