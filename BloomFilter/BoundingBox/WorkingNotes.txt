Things to be implemented:

1) Partition into multiple bounding boxes based on periodic boundary conditions
	-Treat each dimension independently
	-Also consider the case where cluster doesn't cross over, but with added padding
	 it will

2) Bloom Filter probing for cells within bounding sphere
	-Create Bloom filter for each cell in each timestep

3) Use Bounding spheres instead of boxes
	-For padding, just find bounding sphere then add padding to the radius
	-Replace process of finding potential PH cells, the change should be
	 transparent to the rest of the code
